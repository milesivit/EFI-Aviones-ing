    <p class="font-weight-bold">Backend Development Workflow</p>
    <p>
      The backend of this application was developed using Django, following a structured and modular approach.
      We implemented the complete backend flow which includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Model:</strong> Definition of the database structure.</li>
      <li><strong>Repository:</strong> (optional layer) Encapsulation of database access logic.</li>
      <li><strong>Service:</strong> Implementation of business logic and application rules.</li>
      <li><strong>View:</strong> Definition of the logic to handle HTTP requests and responses.</li>
      <li><strong>URL:</strong> Configuration of routes to connect views with accessible endpoints.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This separation of concerns ensures clean code, easier maintenance, and better scalability.
    </p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold mt-4">Data Models and Relationships</p>
    <p>
      The system models cover key entities of an airline application. Here's a brief overview:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Plane:</strong> Represents aircrafts, with model, capacity, rows and columns.</li>
      <li><strong>User:</strong> System users (e.g. admin, vendors) with login credentials and roles.</li>
      <li><strong>Flight:</strong> Flights with origin, destination, timing, base price, linked to a plane and users.</li>
      <li><strong>Passenger:</strong> Personal information of individuals booking flights.</li>
      <li><strong>Seat:</strong> Specific seats in a plane, including row, column, type and status.</li>
      <li><strong>Reservation:</strong> A passengerâ€™s booking, linked to a flight, seat and passenger, with a unique code.</li>
      <li><strong>Ticket:</strong> Issued ticket for a reservation, with barcode and issue date.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These models are interconnected through ForeignKey and OneToOne relations, ensuring data consistency and efficient retrieval.
